# RENV_PATHS_LIBRARY_ROOT below exists because I had tried this:
# https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/345#issuecomment-959114458
# because I was having trouble with renv and devtools::build()
# I commented out because it seemed unnecessary but I am leaving it in just
# in case the issue resurfaces
# RENV_PATHS_LIBRARY_ROOT="~/.renv/library"
